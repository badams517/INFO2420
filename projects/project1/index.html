            My first impression of the website is that there are a lot of popups
            and it is kind of messy. There are a lot of pictures for certain
            tabs and in the background. It reminds me of old-fashioned or a
            farmy feel. With all the different pictures, I don't really know
            what the focal point of the webpage is supposed to be.
          </li>
          <li>
            The information seems pretty straightforward but also a little
            cluttered because of the pictures. Structurally for the content
            itself it seems easy to follow for the content itself (if there
            isn't any CSS or pictures/ styling). However, the style and pictures
            should add to the content it takes away from it. It does have a
            color scheme but still seems a little cluttered. They have links on
            the left and in text as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site structure does not make sense to me. It is very cluttered
            because of the pictures and the popups. It is hard to focus on the
            content. The pictures are very distracting and take away from what
            the content is trying to portray.
          </li>
          <li>
            The graphics and layout detract from the site's content rather than
            enhance or help portray the message it is trying to get across. The
            pictures are very cluttered which makes it hard to follow the
            content. The pictures do follow a similar scheme or theme but there
            should be fewer of them. The pictures should be placed more
            strategically, but I have more of a minimalist style.
          </li>
          <li>
            The home page took 7.99 seconds to load according to the network tab
            in the developer tools. I think that is a pretty slow load time
            because typically a webpage should load in about 3 seconds or less.
            I think because of the amount of pictures. But also with it being a
            React app it should be faster but the different JavaScript bundles
            can cause it to be slower. After inspecting the webpage there are
            bundles that are kind of big which create overhead to the website.
            Also, my internet speed is 390 Mbps which is fast but we have
            multiple computers and devices connected to it which can slow down
            the internet speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The text color I think made a lot of sense because the style reminds
            of a farmy feel. The text color is a light gray and some browns
            which is easy to read with the white background.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site does have a navigation bar which is pretty easy to follow.
            This is really nice because of the React routing which renders a
            virtual DOM making it quick to navigate to different pages. The
            navigation is easy to follow and straightforward.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site has a fall color scheme which is repeated on all the pages.
            It is more to showcase their fall products especially with the
            pumpkins and the fall colors. The color scheme is very consistent
            with the fall theme.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site does respond well to smaller window sizes. I think the site
            looks better. I think the site looks better on a smaller screen
            because it is less cluttered and fills in some of those empty
            spaces. But I think the design layout isn't as intuitive to be more
            versatile to different screen sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            It allows creating a shopping list which can be used when shopping
            at the store. But also it has a recipe section that uses its
            products which I haven't really seen on other websites. It is a
            smart marketing move to get people to buy their products.
