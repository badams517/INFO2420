            "In 1997, Master Chef Pierre DeBois moved to Utah from New York
            where he owned and managed a small restaurant called Ma Maison (My
            Home). His restaurant specialized in French Nouvelle cuisine. Once
            in Salt Lake City, he realized that the average Utahan doesn't have
            much appreciation for high cuisine. Pierre and his family were
            invited to a neighborhood block party one summer and it was there he
            had his first encounter with Native Cooking of Utah. Pierre noticed
            how much the locals enjoyed the items brought to this pot luck
            dinner. They often went back for seconds or thirds. How could he
            capture this enthusiasm for eating and translate it into his own
            cooking? In order to answer this question, he began a year long
            quest to find out the reason for the success of Utah cuisine."</i

            >So in 2010, Pierre DeBois began gathering recipes for an online
            cookbook titled: Native Cooking of Utah. Everywhere he could, he
            begged, borrowed or stole the secret recipes of popular Utah cooks.
            Many of these recipes had been handed down from generation to
            generation. In fact, the most well known recipe for green jello even
            was honored with its own Olympic pin.</i

            area of the state. For example, salt water taffy from Salt Lake
            City, and Bear Lake Raspberry ice cream from Bear Lake. Chef Pierre
            DeBois has traveled the state to gather these recipes. Read the

    Native Cooking of Utah has become one of the most popular cooking sites in the Western U.S. 
    with over 10,000 hits per week. Chef Pierre DeBois has plans to expand the site to include 
    cooking utensils and kitchen accessories used or hand-made by native Utahans. Not only can you 
    use this web site to help you to create true Utahan cuisine, now you can look the part. You 
    will find these added treats online after January, 2013.
